# Task-05_CyberSecurityIntern

ðŸ“Œ Objective

  To capture live network traffic using Wireshark, identify and analyze basic network protocols such as HTTP, DNS, and TCP, and gain hands-on experience in packet capturing, filtering, and protocol recognition. This exercise aims to develop foundational skills in network        traffic analysis and enhance understanding of how different protocols operate within a network

---

## ðŸ›  Tools
  - Wireshark (Free and open-source)

     ðŸ“‚ Deliverables
  -A packet capture file (.pcap)
  - A short report summarizing protocols identified

## ðŸš€ Steps to Perform

 1. Install Wireshark
    - Download from: [https://www.wireshark.org/download.html](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html)

 2. Start Capturing
    - Open Wireshark
    - Select your active network interface (Wi-Fi/Ethernet)
    - Click the blue shark fin icon to start capture

 3. Generate Network Traffic
    - Browse different websites
    - Optionally run:  
     
      ping google.com
      
    - This will ensure packets are captured

 4. Stop Capture
    - After ~1 minute, click the red square stop button

 5. Filter Captured Packets
    - In the display filter bar, use:
      - http â†’ Show HTTP traffic
      - dns â†’ Show DNS queries/responses
      - tcp â†’ Show TCP connections

 6. Identify at least 3 Protocols
    - Example:
      - HTTP â€“ Web browsing requests/responses
      - DNS â€“ Resolving domain names to IPs
      - TCP â€“ Transport layer communication
      - (Optional: ICMP for ping requests)

 7. Export Capture
    - File â†’ Save As â†’ network_capture.pcap
